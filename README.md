## About The Project
'Tis the season to be making. Combining the power of the Web Audio API, React, Node and Express, this festive project makes use of the incredibly versatile Raspberry Pi to create a full-stack application that not only has a stunning UI that syncs some christmas light visualizations with music, but controls circuits of lights in real life that correspond to the same music/lights. You may have seen either a christmas light show set to music in person or a christmas light type of visualizer in the browser. Where this project really sticks out is in its' marrying of these two ideas and creating the best of both worlds where you can view the show in person and/or listen all from your phone and have a degree of control over the playlist. The Pi handles hosting of the Node server, audio files, and React-based front-end that contains the interactive UI. Using Express to build an API on the Node server, it communicates all data corresponding with the audio files (mp3) themselves, binary files created with FFT analyzation to turn relays on/off, and timing related offsets to keep everything synced. It should be noted that this is still a work in progress and is scheduled to be completed sometime in December 2022 before Christmas.
